#### Use at your own risk
**=====================**

Created spamcomment.py and the purpose is simple:
  1. Enter hashtag to browse
  2. Enter the word you want to comment
    (ex: #myhashtag)
  3. The script will go to some of the pictures under the hashtag entered
      and comment your #myhashtag;
